The announcement text for ksh 93u+m/1.1 is under development.

### MAIN CHANGES between ksh 93u+m/1.0.x and 93u+m/1.1.0 ###

New features in shell options:

- A new --globex shell option allows pathname expansion of extended patterns
  (those with a syntax involving parentheses) from fields resulting from
  field splitting (e.g., unquoted variables as command arguments). This
  remains disabled by default for compatibility with POSIX and ksh88.

New features in shell variables:

- SRANDOM is a secure random number generator. It uses the OS implementation
  of arc4random(3) or, absent that, an integrated OpenBSD-based version that
  uses the ChaCha20 cipher. An upper bound can be set by assigning its value
  to SRANDOM; subsequent numbers will be uniformly distributed between 0 and
  the value of the upper bound minus one, in a way that avoids "modulo bias".
